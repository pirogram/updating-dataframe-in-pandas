    It is very common during the _data cleaning_ or _data wrangling_ phase to transform the values of a variable or derive new variables from an existing one. For example, a weather station may record all the temperature related observations in _Celsius_ but we may want to convert it to _Fahrenheit_. Or we may have a dump of tweets data and want to extract hashtags from the tweet and store them in another column.

    In this module, we'll first look at the fundamentals of mutating a `DataFrame` and then we'll work through several practical problems and see how to solve them.

    To learn the fundamentals of mutating a `DataFrame`, we'll look at the following:
    * Adding/Removing/Updating Columns
    * Removing/Updating Observations

    We'll skip the bit about _Adding Observations_ since that's used more for augmenting a dataset rather than cleaning a dataset.
